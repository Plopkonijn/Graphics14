We regulary met and implemented everything together.

We haven't implemented any of the bonus assignments.

In the assignment on Lambert shading we've used a pointlight. The intensity is distance dependend. In the further assignments we've adjusted the formula.

In the assignment on Phongshading we decided to implement Blinn-Phong. We created a method PhongColor (above the code for the pixelshader and LambertColor). The pixelshader calls the method LambertColor. In the method LambertColor, the PhongColor is added up to the output.
